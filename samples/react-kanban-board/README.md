# Kanban Board

## Summary


This solution contains an SPFx webpart that shows a kanban board using Office UI Fabric components ([Office UI Fabric](https://developer.microsoft.com/fluentui/)).
The webpart uses the default columns of the SharePoint Tasks list for showing the board's columns and the tasks.
