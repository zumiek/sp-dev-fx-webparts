## Features

This demonstrates how you can create a fun game to play with your SharePoint peers. It was built using React and also uses jQuery to help load the Word List. It demonstrates these features:

- SharePoint REST API's
  - Creating List and List Items API
  - Creating columns in a SharePoint List
- Web Part Property Pane Settings
- CSS Styling and Animations
- Fun and engaging UX
- Responsive Design


If you want to disable the high scores feature you can edit the Web Part Settings. The Web Part stores the high scores in a SharePoint List that it creates called WordGameList. You can also change the Game Title in the settings:

It also uses responsive design which works great on the SharePoint Mobile App:
