# Personal Tasks

> NOTE: This sample is available in the [PnP Starter Kit](https://github.com/pnp/sp-starter-kit). You can find the sample code for this web part at https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-starter-kit/tree/master/solution/src/webparts/personalTasks.

This web part provides you the ability to add a particular user's personal tasks on a web page. The web part may be configured to show all tasks or to exclude completed tasks. This web part is powered by the Microsoft Graph and currently requires that the Office 365 tenant be configured for targeted release for all users.
