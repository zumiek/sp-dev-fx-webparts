# List Form

## Summary

The List Form web part is a web part for adding a list form to any page. It provides a working example of implementing generic SharePoint list forms using the **SharePoint Framework (SPFx)** and the _React_ and _Office UI Fabric_ libraries.

The web part allows configuring which list to use and if a form for adding a new item, editing or displaying an existing item should be shown. When selecting display or edit form the ID can be defined either as a fixed number or as a query string parameter name. The form fields can be added, ordered using drag-and-drop or removed visually in the web part. A URL including placeholder for the ID can be provided to redirect to after successfully saving the form.
