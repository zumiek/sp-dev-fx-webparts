# Accordion Section -- FAQ Builder

## Summary

* Adds a collapsible accordion section to an Office 365 SharePoint page or Teams Tab.
* Ideal for creating FAQs.
* When adding the web part, you'll be prompted to select a list from a property panel dropdown (target list must have a Title column and Content column).  This will generate an accordion with one section for each item in the list.
* Modifications/deletions/additions to the list items in the target list of an added web part are automatically reflected on the page.
* To deploy to a Teams tab see current [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/get-started/using-web-part-as-ms-teams-tab).

### Usage

**1) Create or use a list with a Title and a Content column:**
* The value in the Title column for each item will appear in the heading bars of the Accordion.  
* The value in the Content column for each item will appear in the collapsible content section of the Accordion
* When creating the columns, select "Multiple lines of text".  Rich text is now supported within the Content column.
