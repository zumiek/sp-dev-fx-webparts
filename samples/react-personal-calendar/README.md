# Personal Calendar

> NOTE: This sample is available in the [PnP Starter Kit](https://github.com/pnp/sp-starter-kit). You can find the sample code for this web part at https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-starter-kit/tree/master/solution/src/webparts/personalCalendar.

This web part provides you the ability to add a particular user's personal calendar on a web page. The web part may be configured to automatically refresh, as well as display up to seven days of events and a pre-defined number of events at a time. This web part is powered by the Microsoft Graph and currently requires that the Office 365 tenant be configured for targeted release for all users.
