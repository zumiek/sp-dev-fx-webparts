# Pages Hierarchy

## Summary

This web part allows users to create a faux page hierarchy in their pages library and use it for page-to-page navigation.  It will ask you to create a page parent property on first use which is then used by the web part to either show a breadcrumb of the current pages ancestors or buttons for the pages children.

## Features

This web part isn't anything fancy but it's useful for some scenarios.

* Parent Page Property Creation - if the web part is added to a page and the Parent Page property does not exist the user will be asked to enable (create) it.
* Security - if the user editing the page/web part doesn't have 'Manage' permissions on the Pages library they will not get the enable button, instead a message telling them to get a site owner to do the enabling.
* Two page relationship views depending on the direction you want to show
  * Ancestors shows a breadcrumb view (including the current page) up to parent pages until the parent page property is not set.
  * Children shows a button view for all pages that have selected the current page as their parent.
