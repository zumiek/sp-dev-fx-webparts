# Tiles

> NOTE: This sample is available in the [PnP Starter Kit](https://github.com/pnp/sp-starter-kit). You can find the sample code for this web part at https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-starter-kit/tree/master/solution/src/webparts/tiles.

This web part provides you the ability to add a per instance listing of tiled links. Tiles are stored as a collection of tiles within the web part's properties, removing the need for link storage within SharePoint lists, tenant properties, or other external link storage requirements.

Icons are from Office UI Fabric.
