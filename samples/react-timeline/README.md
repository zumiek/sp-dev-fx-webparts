### SharePoint Asset

A SharePoint list (named "Timeline") is provisioned to store the timeline information, along with supported site columns and content type. The schema of the list is as below.
![List Schema][figure6]

- The "Title" column stores the event title.
- The "Event Date" column represents the date of event.
- The "Picture" column stores the url of image to be displayed for the event.
- The "Link" column represents the url to event.
- The "Description" column represents the more information about the event.

The sample also provisions sample data to the "Timeline" list, which can be used as an example to start using the web part.
