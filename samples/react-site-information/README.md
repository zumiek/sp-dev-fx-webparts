# Site Information

> NOTE: This sample is available in the [PnP Starter Kit](https://github.com/pnp/sp-starter-kit). You can find the sample code for this web part at https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-starter-kit/tree/master/solution/src/webparts/siteInformation.


This web part provides you the ability to collect and present additional metadata on a web page for group associated team sites. The web part may be configured to display site title, a site contacts powered by a people picker, and a term from the term store, often used to provide classification for the site.

This web part is intended to be used once within a group associated team site to provide additional metadata. This web part provides an extensability framework in which to customize the web part code base to include additional properties and thus site metadata. Additional method demonstrations include the PnP Property Control people picker and the PnP Property Control term picker.

The term store must include the term group name, `PnPTermSets`, which incudes a Term Set, `PnP-Organizations`. Terms should be placed within this term set. The term group, term set, and default terms are added by the Starter Kit provisioning process, in particular set within the `./provisioning/terms.xml` provisioning template.
