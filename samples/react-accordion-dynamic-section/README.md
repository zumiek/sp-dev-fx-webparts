# Dynamic Accordion - FAQ Builder

## Summary

- This sample is based on [Erik Benke] and [Mike Zimmerman] (Accordion Section FAQ Builder web part. I has extended it support single FAQs list based on Category and dynamic properties selection.
- Adds a collapsible accordion section to an Office 365 SharePoint page or Teams Tab.
- Ideal for displaying FAQs.
- When adding the web part, you'll be prompted to select a list from a property panel dropdown (target list must be created with FAQ type Question and Answer.).
- The web part expects a choice type that will be used as Category.
- The web part will automatically load all the properties in two dropdowns. One for Accordion Title and One for Accordion Content that must be html type.
- This will generate an accordion with one section for each item in the list.
- Modifications/deletions/additions to the list items in the target list of an added web part are automatically reflected on the page.
- To deploy to a Teams tab see current [Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/get-started/using-web-part-as-ms-teams-tab).
