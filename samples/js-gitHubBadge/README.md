## Features
It's not the prettiest thing in the world, but the goal here was to create a web part that demonstrates something a bit beyond the standard "Hello, World!" web part in which we change some HTML. This sample shows how to pull in data from somewhere without authentication and without over-complicating things.

Future samples will refactor this into something more professional that follows recommended coding patterns and practices and leverage modern frameworks.

Ultimately, this sample along with its yet-to-be-created future samples could be a useful teaching tool to developers new to SPFx as well as developers who aren't well-versed in SPFx coding patterns or the various frameworks available.
