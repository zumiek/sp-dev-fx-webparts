# Image Gallery Built with Adaptive Cards

## Summary 

This sample demonstrates the capability of using [Adaptive Cards](https://adaptivecards.io/) with SharePoint Framework. Adaptive cards are great fit for Bot, however they can be effectively used with SPFx to render the content. This web part helps to display the image gallery from SharePoint list.

When added to SharePoint site, the source list containing images information, number of images to display can be configured from web part properties.
The sample also provisions the list called "Adaptive Card Images" which can be used as an example to start using the web part.
