# Stock Information

> NOTE: This sample is available in the [PnP Starter Kit](https://github.com/pnp/sp-starter-kit). You can find the sample code for this web part at https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-starter-kit/tree/master/solution/src/webparts/stockInformation.

This web part provides you the ability to display basic stock information for one publicly traded stock on a web page. The web part may be configured to display a stock based on stock symbol as well as be set to automatically refresh the stock information every 60 (sixty) seconds. The web part depends on a service provided by [Alpha Advantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/). [Learn how to register for your api key](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-starter-kit/blob/master/documentation/tenant-settings.md#request-a-custom-api-key-to-alpha-vantage).

The api key provided by Alpha Advantage is added as a tenant property by the Starter Kit provisioning process. [Use the -StockAPIKey parameter when deploying the kit](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-starter-kit/tree/master/provisioning#-stockapikey).

By default, the `Stock Information` web part will use the stock symbol set during the Starter Kit provisioning process when the [-StockSymbol](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-starter-kit/tree/master/provisioning#-stocksymbol) parameter is provided. The default stock symbol is `MSFT`. The stock symbol may be customized per web part instance.
